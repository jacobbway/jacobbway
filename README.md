Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at UW Stout studying Computer Science\n
  -Following the Secure Software Development and Cybersecurity Track\n
  -Graduating after the fall semester of 2026!\n
  -Currently Looking for internships for the summer of 2026 (Preferably Eau Claire Area, but will 100% move)\n

I am currently teaching myself Open GL on the side as I would like to make some sort of video game some day before I am old. \n
  A Rogue Lite is the dream (Shape of Dreams, Hereos of Hammerwatch, HyperLight Breaker etc.)
